## Introduction

This repository provides the code examples from the book **Build Your Own Neural Networks: Step-By-Step Explanation For Beginners**. You will find complete scripts that can be run directly, as well as code snippets illustrating specific concepts. Please use the code with care and attention to context, as some snippets are intended only to demonstrate usage and might require additional setup to run.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required Python packages using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Chapter Codes
Each code file is named according to the chapter and section from the book. Below is a brief description of what you can find in each file:
Chapter 1: Introduction to Neural Networks
	1.2 How Do Neural Networks Work.ipynb
	1.3 Applications of Neural Networks.ipynb
Chapter 2: Setup and Installation
